SDIrc Server Specs-

Server Must listen for incoming connections from clients.
When a client connects the the server it will accept the connection
and store the new connection socket in a list of connected sockets.
The very first thing that should be sent from the client is a /nick command
with the clients computer name. The address should then be stored in a dictionary
as the key with the value being the user name/nickname of the user connected to the port.

Next the server needs to check all connected ports for incoming messages from the clients.
It will use select to find all sockets with available messages and loop through them parsing
out the command and fulfill the command and then broadcast to all clients logged into the 
server.

SDIrc Client Specs -
/alt The client first checks to see if it is connected to a server, if
not it gets the computer name and waits for user to type in command/.
Client first connects to server. The very first thing the client does
after making connection with the server is send a /nick command with
the clients name taken as the user name from the computer.
